##### Fig 3A i

**corre_racipe.py** generates **Fig 3A i RACIPE correlation matrix**  using **RACIPE** data which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PKs5vHkXCoJm9Wcg7P4nBPdPrFJCxJ5B?usp=sharing). Place data of only one trail in the folder and run the python script to generate the figure


**influence.py** generates **Influence** matrices from Boolean Steady state distribution which can be found [here](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/Simulation_Data). Place data on only one traisl in the folder and run the python script to generate the figure.

##### Fig 3A ii

**scatter_corre_influ.py** generates the scatter plots of **Fig 3A ii**. The **Influence** matrix (path length 10 in this case) is generated by **influence.py** which takes in **intermat.f** which contains Interaction matrix of WT SCLC network. The **RACIPE correlation matrix** is generated by **pca_racipe.py** present [here](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/tree/master/Figures/Fig%203/Fig%203A/A%20ii/RACIPE). It creates a pickles binary file of **RACIPE correlation matric** with the name **racipe_corre.data**, which is then used by **scatter_corre_influ.py**. 

**NOTE:** Influence matrix of path length 10 is used for this analysis.
