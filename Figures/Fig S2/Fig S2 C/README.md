**effective_edges.py** calculates the effective activation/inhibition from one group of genes to other. For **Reduced model 2**, use **Interaction matrix** to calculate the effective edges.

Steady state distribution of **Reduced Model 2** can generated using [Fast-Bool](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/tree/master/Additional_Codes/Fast-Bool), by using the **model1** .ids and .topo file. Mean and standard deviation of the resulting frequencies for several runs are given in **model2.csv**. **states_hist.py** takes in **model2.csv** and plots the bargraph.
