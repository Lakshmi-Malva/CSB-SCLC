##### Fig S2 A i

**scatter_corre_influ.py** generates the **Scatter Plot of R1 and R2 values WT SCLC network** using the **Influence** matrix of WT SCLC network (path length 10 in this case) which are generated by **influence.py** which takes dependency on **intermat.f** of the WT SCLC network (contains Interaction matrix of WT SCLC network) and the **RACIPE correlation matrix** which is generated by **pca_racipe.py** present [here](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/tree/master/Figures/Fig%20S2/Fig%20S2%20A/A%20i/RACIPE). It creates a pickles binary file of **RACIPE correlation matrix** with the name **racipe_corre.data** from RACIPE steady state distribution file found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PKs5vHkXCoJm9Wcg7P4nBPdPrFJCxJ5B?usp=sharing), which is then used by **scatter_corre_influ.py**.

##### Fig S2 A ii

Similar to **Fig S2 A i**, **scatter_corre_influ.py** generates the corresponding plot. But, instead of using **RACIPE correlation matrix**, the codes uses **CCLE Correlation matrix** to calculate **R1** and **R2** metrics. The codes uses **ccle_corre.data** and **ccle_p.data** generated by **pca_CCLE.py** under this [folder](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/tree/master/Figures/Fig%20S2/Fig%20S2%20A/A%20ii/ccle) which takes dependency on **ccle.data**. **ccle.data** can be created using [this](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/blob/master/Additional_Codes/BioData-Analysis/pickle_data.py) by passing **CCLE.input** command to **data_analysis.py** in the linked folder.
