### Fig 5

All figures in Fig 5A, Fg 5B and Fig 5C can be generated using ``BioData_Analysis`` which can be found [here](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/tree/master/Additional_Codes/BioData-Analysis). Place ``CCLE.input`` file in the ``input`` folder of ``BioData_Analysis`` and run the code as mentioned [here](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/tree/master/Additional_Codes/BioData-Analysis/README.md). A folder by name ``CCLE`` will be generated and all the plots are savded to that folder.As Hieracheal clustering gives highlights formation of 5 clusters, N is taken as 5 in ``Hier_Scattering.py``.

**NOTE**: Bargraphs of several K values are generated and saved to ``bargraph`` folder. UMAP analysis is done for 4 trails and all the plots generated for UMAP analysis are saved to ``UMAP`` folder.
