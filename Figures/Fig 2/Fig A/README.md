### Fig 2A

##### Fig 2A i

``correlation.py`` generates the **Fig 2A i** using Boolean Simulation data which can be found [here](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/tree/master/Simulation_Data/Boolean). Place data file of one trial into this folder and run the python script.

##### Fig 2A ii

``plot_random_corre.py`` generates the **Fig 2A ii** using ``Boolean_J_vals.xlsx`` which can be generated from [``Boolean_Random_Networks``](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/tree/master/Additional_Codes/Boolean_Random_Networks) and ``RACIPE_J_vals.xlsx`` which can be generated by ``RACIPE_random_correltaion.py``. Place a data file of RACIPE from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PKs5vHkXCoJm9Wcg7P4nBPdPrFJCxJ5B?usp=sharing) and run the code to generate the Excel sheet of J values.

``Boolean_J_vals.xlsx`` contains J values of continuous form of Correlation matrices (Discrete to Continuous using Random number sampling from Uniform distribution. For more information go through the SI material) of Random Boolean Networks states (1000 continuous matrices for each Random Network).
Similarly, ``RACIPE_J_vals.xlsx`` contains J values of continuous form of Correlation matrices from RACIPE state distribution (1000 continuous matrices from RACIPE correlation matrix)
