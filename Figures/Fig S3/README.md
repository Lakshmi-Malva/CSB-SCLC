##### Fig S3 A and B


All figures in Fig 4B and Fig 4C can be generated using **BioData_Analysis** which can be found [here](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/tree/master/Additional_Codes/BioData-Analysis) using **GSM73160 Dataset**. Place ``73160.input`` file in the ``input`` folder of ``BioData_Analysis`` and run the code as mentioned [here](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/tree/master/Additional_Codes/BioData-Analysis/README.md). A folder by name ``73160`` will be generated and all the plots are saved to that folder. As Hieracheal clustering gives highlights formation of 4 clusters, N is taken as 4 in ``Hier_Scattering.py``.

**NOTE**: Bargraphs of several K values are generated and saved to ``Bargraphs`` folder.
