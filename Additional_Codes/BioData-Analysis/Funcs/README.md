## Functions

Here are the functions that can be used for data analysis. Any custom function can added as well. Just make sure that you import that function in [**data_analysis.py**](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/blob/master/Additional_Codes/BioData-Analysis/data_analysis.py). Follow the instructions specified [here](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/blob/master/Additional_Codes/BioData-Analysis/README.md) to use these functions for analysis.
